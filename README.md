# Practical Econometrics with Wooldridge  
_A simulation-driven, hands-on journey through introductory econometrics_

## Purpose of This Repository

This repository is a personal initiative to **supplement the study of econometrics** through:
- **Simulations**,  
- **Visualizations**, and  
- **Solved exercises** based on *Introductory Econometrics: A Modern Approach* by Jeffrey M. Wooldridge.

While Wooldridge's textbook serves as the **primary resource**, this repository is designed to **aid better comprehension** of key econometric concepts through Python-based experimentation.

> ⚠️ **Disclaimer:** This is *not* a complete or authoritative guide to econometrics. It is meant to be **supplementary material** to enhance intuition and understanding—not a replacement for thorough textbook study.

## What You’ll Find Here

- **Simulations and Visual Intuition:** To explain concepts like unbiasedness, omitted variable bias, heteroskedasticity, and more.
- **Solutions to End-of-Chapter Questions:**  
   Both **theoretical** and **computer exercises** from each chapter of the Wooldridge textbook will be addressed, progressively.
- **Practical Applications:** Regressions using real datasets (`wooldridge` package), visual interpretations, and annotated code for learning.

## Collaboration and Feedback

I’m a learner too—and that means I’m still growing and making mistakes!  
If you find anything incorrect, unclear, or if you have ideas for how to improve this repository, I would genuinely love your feedback.  
Feel free to:
- Suggest improvements  
- Point out bugs or mistakes  
- Contribute with better simulations or solutions  
- Share learning strategies

> You can reach out to me on **LinkedIn** if you'd like to connect, collaborate, or simply share your thoughts.

## Continuous Updates

This is a **long-term project**. I’ll be updating the repository regularly as I progress through the book, and as I receive suggestions from peers, mentors, and fellow learners.  
Expect to see new simulations, better visualizations, and refined content over time.
